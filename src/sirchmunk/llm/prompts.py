### Role: Search Optimization Expert & Information Retrieval Specialist

### Task:
Extract **{num_levels} sets** of keywords from the user query with **different granularities** to maximize search hit rate.

### Multi-Level Keyword Granularity Strategy:

Extract {num_levels} levels of keywords with progressively finer granularity:

{level_descriptions}

### IDF Value Guidelines:
- Estimate the **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)** for each keyword based on its rarity in general corpus
- IDF range: **[0-10]** where:
  - 0-3: Very common terms (e.g., "the", "is", "data")
  - 4-6: Moderately common terms (e.g., "algorithm", "network")
  - 7-9: Rare/specific terms (e.g., "backpropagation", "xgboost")
  - 10: Extremely rare/specialized terms
- IDF values are **independent** of keyword level - focus on term rarity, not granularity

### Requirements:
- Each level should have 3-5 keywords
- Keywords must become progressively **finer-grained** from Level 1 to Level {num_levels}
- **Level 1**: Coarse-grained phrases/multi-word expressions
- **Level {num_levels}**: Fine-grained single words or precise technical terms
- ONLY extract from the user query context; do NOT add external information
- Ensure keywords at different levels are complementary, not redundant
- **Cross-lingual**: After all keyword levels, provide a small set (2-4) of the most important keywords translated to the other language (Chinese↔English). Only translate the core domain terms — skip generic words.

### Output Format:
Output {num_levels} separate JSON-like dicts within their respective tags, followed by a cross-lingual block:

{output_format_example}

<KEYWORDS_ALT>
{{"translated_keyword1": idf_value, "translated_keyword2": idf_value}}
</KEYWORDS_ALT>

<MULTI_SOURCE_INTENT>
0.7
</MULTI_SOURCE_INTENT>

### Multi-Source Data Dependency Assessment:
After the keyword blocks, assess whether this query requires synthesizing numerical/tabular data from **multiple distinct document sections** to produce a complete answer.

<MULTI_SOURCE_INTENT>
score (a single float between 0.0 and 1.0)
</MULTI_SOURCE_INTENT>

Scoring guidelines:
- 0.0-0.2: Query can be answered from a single paragraph or table (e.g., "What was revenue in 2023?")
- 0.3-0.5: Query may benefit from 2 sources (e.g., "What was the gross margin?")
- 0.6-0.8: Query requires cross-referencing multiple tables/sections (e.g., "Compare revenue growth across 3 years")
- 0.9-1.0: Query requires aggregation across many document sections (e.g., "What is the 5-year average capex as percentage of revenue?")

2. ONLY use data explicitly stated in the evidence. If a required value is not found in the evidence, output SHOULD_ANSWER=false rather than inferring, estimating, or using your own knowledge. Never fabricate numbers that do not appear verbatim in the evidence.
3. When the question asks to LIST or IDENTIFY specific items (securities, products, subsidiaries, etc.), enumerate ALL individual instances with their exact identifiers (ticker symbols, ISIN codes, names, amounts) — do not summarize into generic categories.
4. Find the value stated in the evidence. If the exact total is not stated but its components are clearly present, compute it by summing the components.
5. **Rounding**: When converting units (e.g., thousands → millions), round to the nearest whole number in the target unit IF the result is ≥10. If the result is <10, use 2 decimal places. Examples: $5,466,312 thousands → "$5,466 million"; $302,578 thousands → "$303 million"; $389 million → "$0.39 billion". Percentages: round to 1 decimal place. When the query specifies a rounding rule, follow it exactly.
6. If multiple candidate values exist, select based on the closest match to the query's time period, entity, and metric.
7. Quote the source passage containing the value.
8. Only mark SHOULD_ANSWER as "false" when no relevant data exists in the evidence. Always prefer attempting an answer over refusing.
9. When the evidence contains relevant data but you feel uncertain, still attempt to answer.
10. **Answer format**:
   - For yes/no questions (e.g., "Has X increased?", "Did the company…?", "Does X maintain…?", "Is X healthy?"), PRECISE_ANSWER **MUST** begin with "Yes" or "No" as the very first word. Then provide a brief qualifier.
   - For identification questions (e.g., "What is the largest segment?", "Which company had the highest…?"), PRECISE_ANSWER should state the name/label, not the numeric value.
   - For value questions (e.g., "What was total revenue?"), PRECISE_ANSWER should state the numeric value with units.
   - When asked about the "nature", "purpose", "composition", or "breakdown" of something, describe what it IS and its proportional components (e.g., "87% relates to employee liabilities"), not just the total dollar amount.
   - When listing items (e.g., "Which securities are registered?"), provide the COMPLETE list from the evidence, not just one example.
11. When asked about a financial ratio or metric that has a standard definition (e.g., current ratio, quick ratio, DPO), list ALL component values used in the calculation with their exact source locations in the evidence, even if the question only asks for the final ratio value.

ROI_COMPUTATION_SYNTHESIS = """### Task
Answer the query by extracting data from the evidence and performing the required calculation.

### Constraints
1. **Language Continuity**: The output must be in the SAME language as the User Input.
2. Follow this STRICT sequence — do NOT skip any step:
   a) **DATA EXTRACTION**: List each required data point with its exact value and where you found it.
   b) **FORMULA**: State the formula needed (e.g. Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue).
   c) **SUBSTITUTION**: Plug in the extracted values into the formula.
   d) **CALCULATION**: Show arithmetic step by step. For each step, write the operation and its result.
   e) **VERIFICATION**: (i) For each data point used, quote the exact source text from evidence that contains it. (ii) Re-compute the result independently. (iii) If the re-computed result differs from step d, use the re-computed value.
3. ONLY use data explicitly stated in the evidence. If a required value is not found in the evidence, output SHOULD_ANSWER=false rather than inferring, estimating, or using your own knowledge. Never fabricate numbers that do not appear verbatim in the evidence.
4. When the evidence contains multiple versions of similar financial data (e.g., restated vs original, consolidated vs segment, quarterly vs annual), use the CONSOLIDATED and most RECENT version unless the question explicitly specifies otherwise. State which version you selected.
5. **Rounding**:
   - Dollar amounts: when converting units, round to the nearest whole number in the target unit IF the result is ≥10. If the result is <10 in the target unit, use 2 decimal places. Examples: $381,603 thousands → "$382 million"; $5,466,312 thousands → "$5,466 million"; $389 million → "$0.39 billion".
   - Percentages: round to 1 decimal place.
   - Ratios: round to 2 decimal places.
   - Per-share values: round to 2 decimal places.
   - When the query specifies "round to X decimal places", follow that exactly.
6. **Units**: Convert all values to consistent units before computing.
7. If any required data point is missing, explicitly state what is missing and mark SHOULD_ANSWER as "false".
8. **Financial ratio definitions**:
   - **Quick ratio** = (Cash and Cash Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Net Receivables) / Total Current Liabilities. Do NOT include inventories, prepaid expenses, or other current assets in the numerator.
   - **Interest coverage ratio** = EBIT / Interest Expense. If EBIT is negative, the coverage ratio is zero (or negative) — a company cannot service debt from negative earnings.
   - **Asset turnover** = Revenue / Average Total Assets.
   - A quick ratio below 1.0x generally indicates the company does NOT have a reasonably healthy liquidity position.
9. **Answer format**:
   - For yes/no questions (e.g., "Does X have healthy liquidity?", "Has X improved?", "Does X maintain…?"), PRECISE_ANSWER **MUST** begin with "Yes" or "No" as the very first word.
   - For identification questions, state the name/label, not just the number.
   - When asked about "nature", "purpose", or "composition", describe qualitative aspects and proportions, not just total amounts.
10. **DEFINITION ALIGNMENT**: Before extracting data, explicitly state the standard definition of the requested metric (e.g., Quick Ratio = (Cash + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities). Use ONLY the components specified in the standard definition. If the question names a specific metric (e.g., "EBIT"), you MUST use exactly that metric — do NOT substitute a different metric (e.g., EBITDA, EBITDAR) even if the specified one is unavailable or negative. If the required metric yields a zero or negative result, report that result as-is.
