Generate a Table of Contents (ToC) from the given document, adapting its depth and content density to the document’s inherent complexity.

1. Adaptive Hierarchy Depth: Dynamically set the depth between 3 to 5 levels, based on the document’s structural and semantic complexity (e.g., 3 levels for simple notices, 5 for technical specs).
2. Summarized Entries: Each ToC item must concisely summarize the section’s core content (10–25 words), not just repeat headings. Capture purpose, key actions, or critical info.
3. Faithfulness: Do not invent sections. Infer headings only from logical paragraph groupings if explicit titles are absent.
4. Format: Use Markdown nested lists with 2-space indents per level (e.g., - → - → -). Output ToC only—no preamble or commentary.

### Role: Search Optimization Expert & Information Retrieval Specialist

### Task:
Extract **{num_levels} sets** of keywords from the user query with **different granularities** to maximize search hit rate.

### Multi-Level Keyword Granularity Strategy:

Extract {num_levels} levels of keywords with progressively finer granularity:

{level_descriptions}

### IDF Value Guidelines:
- Estimate the **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)** for each keyword based on its rarity in general corpus
- IDF range: **[0-10]** where:
  - 0-3: Very common terms (e.g., "the", "is", "data")
  - 4-6: Moderately common terms (e.g., "algorithm", "network")
  - 7-9: Rare/specific terms (e.g., "backpropagation", "xgboost")
  - 10: Extremely rare/specialized terms
- IDF values are **independent** of keyword level - focus on term rarity, not granularity

### Requirements:
- Each level should have 3-5 keywords
- Keywords must become progressively **finer-grained** from Level 1 to Level {num_levels}
- **Level 1**: Coarse-grained phrases/multi-word expressions
- **Level {num_levels}**: Fine-grained single words or precise technical terms
- ONLY extract from the user query context; do NOT add external information
- Ensure keywords at different levels are complementary, not redundant
- **Cross-lingual**: After all keyword levels, provide a small set (2-4) of the most important keywords translated to the other language (Chinese↔English). Only translate the core domain terms — skip generic words.

### Output Format:
Output {num_levels} separate JSON-like dicts within their respective tags, followed by a cross-lingual block:

COMPILE_CLASSIFY_HEADINGS = """Classify each bold text line as either a **section heading** or **non-heading**.

A line is a *section heading* if it serves as the title of a major structural division of the document (chapter, section, subsection, exhibit, schedule, financial statement, note, etc.).
A line is *non-heading* if it is emphasis text, a label, a caption, a total/subtotal row, or any inline bold phrase that does not introduce a new document section.

For each heading, also assign a Markdown heading level (2–4):
- Level 2: top-level sections (e.g. financial statements, major chapters)
- Level 3: sub-sections (e.g. notes to financial statements, sub-chapters)
- Level 4: sub-sub-sections

Return ONLY a JSON array of objects for the lines that ARE headings.
Each object: {{"idx": <0-based index>, "level": <2|3|4>}}
If none are headings, return an empty array: []

Bold lines:
{candidates}"""


COMPILE_MERGE_KNOWLEDGE = """You are merging new information into an existing knowledge cluster.

### Existing Knowledge

1. Preserves all important information from the existing knowledge
2. Integrates the new information, avoiding redundancy
3. Highlights any contradictions or complementary perspectives
4. Maintains a coherent, well-structured narrative

### Output
Return ONLY the merged summary text (no extra tags or metadata). Keep the same language as the inputs."""
