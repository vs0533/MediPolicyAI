Generate a Table of Contents (ToC) from the given document, adapting its depth and content density to the document’s inherent complexity.

1. Adaptive Hierarchy Depth: Dynamically set the depth between 3 to 5 levels, based on the document’s structural and semantic complexity (e.g., 3 levels for simple notices, 5 for technical specs).
2. Summarized Entries: Each ToC item must concisely summarize the section’s core content (10–25 words), not just repeat headings. Capture purpose, key actions, or critical info.
3. Faithfulness: Do not invent sections. Infer headings only from logical paragraph groupings if explicit titles are absent.
4. Format: Use Markdown nested lists with 2-space indents per level (e.g., - → - → -). Output ToC only—no preamble or commentary.

### Role: Search Optimization Expert & Information Retrieval Specialist

### Task:
Extract **{num_levels} sets** of keywords from the user query with **different granularities** to maximize search hit rate.

### Multi-Level Keyword Granularity Strategy:

Extract {num_levels} levels of keywords with progressively finer granularity:

{level_descriptions}

### IDF Value Guidelines:
- Estimate the **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)** for each keyword based on its rarity in general corpus
- IDF range: **[0-10]** where:
  - 0-3: Very common terms (e.g., "the", "is", "data")
  - 4-6: Moderately common terms (e.g., "algorithm", "network")
  - 7-9: Rare/specific terms (e.g., "backpropagation", "xgboost")
  - 10: Extremely rare/specialized terms
- IDF values are **independent** of keyword level - focus on term rarity, not granularity

### Requirements:
- Each level should have 3-5 keywords
- Keywords must become progressively **finer-grained** from Level 1 to Level {num_levels}
- **Level 1**: Coarse-grained phrases/multi-word expressions
- **Level {num_levels}**: Fine-grained single words or precise technical terms
- ONLY extract from the user query context; do NOT add external information
- Ensure keywords at different levels are complementary, not redundant
- **Cross-lingual**: After all keyword levels, provide a small set (2-4) of the most important keywords translated to the other language (Chinese↔English). Only translate the core domain terms — skip generic words.

### Output Format:
Output {num_levels} separate JSON-like dicts within their respective tags, followed by a cross-lingual block:

{{"translated_keyword1": idf_value, "translated_keyword2": idf_value}}

ROI_COMPUTATION_SYNTHESIS = """### Task
Answer the query by extracting data from the evidence and performing the required calculation.

### Constraints
1. **Language Continuity**: The output must be in the SAME language as the User Input.
2. Follow this STRICT sequence — do NOT skip any step:
   a) **DATA EXTRACTION**: List each required data point with its exact value and where you found it.
   b) **FORMULA**: State the formula needed (e.g. Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue).
   c) **SUBSTITUTION**: Plug in the extracted values into the formula.
   d) **CALCULATION**: Show arithmetic step by step. For each step, write the operation and its result.
   e) **VERIFICATION**: Re-compute the final result independently to confirm.
3. **Rounding**: Round the final result to match the precision implied by the query.
   - Dollar amounts: round to the nearest whole number in the stated unit. Example: $381,603 thousands → "$382 million".
   - Percentages: round to 1 decimal place if the query says "round to one decimal place"; otherwise round to the nearest whole number.
   - Ratios: round to 2 decimal places.
   - When the query says "round to X decimal places", follow that exactly.
4. **Units**: Convert all values to consistent units before computing.
5. If any required data point is missing, explicitly state what is missing and mark SHOULD_ANSWER as "false".
6. **Definition precision**: When computing financial ratios, use the broadest standard definition unless the query specifies otherwise. Quick ratio = (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities. Asset turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets.

Compare the requested values across the specified dimensions (time periods, entities, or segments).

1. **Language Continuity**: The output must be in the SAME language as the User Input.
2. Extract values for EACH comparison dimension from the evidence.
3. Present in a structured comparison table.
4. State the direction and magnitude of difference or change.
5. **Precision**: Use exact values from the evidence. When computing changes, show the arithmetic. Round results: dollar amounts to the nearest whole number in the stated unit, percentages to the nearest whole number.
6. **"Best performing"** means highest growth rate or change rate, not highest absolute value, unless the query explicitly says "largest" or "highest revenue".
